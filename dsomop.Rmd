In this lesson, we will learn how to:

- Set up the required dependencies and connect to a DataSHIELD server
- Create an interface object to interact with an OMOP database
- Explore the available data and identify the concepts of interest
- Retrieve data from the OMOP database using the interface object
- Explore the retrieved data and manipulate it using DataSHIELD functions
- Create cohort definitions using DataSHIELD functions to filter the data
- Perform a practical example of an analysis integrating the retrieved data into the DataSHIELD workflow

# Recommended background knowledge

Before using `dsOMOP`, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of:

- The OMOP CDM structure and its standardized clinical data format. You can learn more about OMOP CDM in the [OHDSI Book chapter 'The Common Data Model'](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/CommonDataModel.html).

- OMOP Vocabularies and how they standardize medical concepts (like diagnoses, medications, procedures) across different coding systems (ICD-9, ICD-10, SNOMED CT, etc.) into a common representation. The [OHDSI Book chapter 'Standardized Vocabularies'](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/StandardizedVocabularies.html) provides a comprehensive overview of this standardization process.

- Basic DataSHIELD concepts and workflow. The [DataSHIELD Beginner's Tutorial](https://data2knowledge.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DSDEV/pages/931069953/Beginners+Tutorial+DataSHIELD+v6.1) is a good starting point.

- For more information about the `dsOMOP` framework, you can visit the [dsOMOP website](https://isglobal-brge.github.io/dsOMOP/).

This knowledge will help you better understand how to effectively query and work with OMOP CDM data through the DataSHIELD infrastructure.

# Initial setup

For this exercise, we will use the following libraries:

```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
library(DSI)
library(DSOpal)
library(dsBaseClient)
library(dsOMOPClient)
library(dsOMOPHelper)
library(dsHelper)
```

We will establish a connection to the demo Opal server. In order to use the OMOP packages and have access to the OMOP database resources, we need to specify the `profile = "omop"` parameter in the login builder:

```{r connection}
builder <- newDSLoginBuilder()
builder$append(server="opal-demo",
              url="https://opal-demo.obiba.org/",
              user="dsuser",
              password="P@ssw0rd",
              driver = "OpalDriver",
              profile = "omop")

logindata <- builder$build()
conns <- datashield.login(logins=logindata)
```

# Creating an OMOP database interface object

We will create an OMOP database interface object using the `ds.omop.helper` function. This interface object provides a set of methods for easily interacting with an OMOP database. 

In our case, we will use the `mimiciv` resource inside the `omop_demo` project, which points to a small sample database formatted in OMOP CDM:

```{r setup}
helper <- ds.omop.helper(
    connections = conns,
    resource = "omop_demo.mimiciv", 
    symbol = "mimiciv"
)
```

This will create both the object `helper` which will assist us in the creation of our desired dataset, and parallely a table in the server side called `mimiciv` (since this is the name we specified in the `symbol` parameter) which will contain the data that we import from the OMOP database.

We can check the list of objects available in the server side using the `ds.ls` function:

```{r ls}
ds.ls()
```

As we can observe, `mimiciv` has been successfully created in the server side. We can check the current state of the `mimiciv` table in the server side at any time using the `ds.summary` function:

```{r summary}
ds.summary("mimiciv")
```

The `mimiciv` table initially contains only the `person` table, as that is the nexus table in the OMOP CDM. This allows us to append data from other tables since all pieces of information are linked to the `person` table, since it is the table that contains the patient identifiers.

Now it is time to retrieve more data and add it to the `mimiciv` object using the `helper` interface object! But first, we need to explore our database to plan the data retrieval.

# Data exploration

The first step is to identify the data that is available in the OMOP database. We can check the available tables using the `tables` method. The table structure should usually one that matches one version of the OMOP CDM (in our case, the `mimiciv` database is formatted in the [OMOP CDM 5.4](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html). This commonly provides a good starting point to understand the structure of our data:

```{r tables}
helper$tables()
```

As expected, the `mimiciv` database presents the structure of the OMOP CDM 5.4:

![OMOP CDM v5.4 schema](images/cdm54.png)

We can also check the columns available in each table using the `columns` method. These should match the columns available in the OMOP CDM documentation for the specific version of the CDM that the database is formatted in. This information is also available in the [OMOP CDM documentation](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html), but is a good reminder of the structure of the data. 

Let's check the columns available in the `condition_occurrence`, `measurement` and `observation` tables:

```{r columns_condition_occurrence}
helper$columns("condition_occurrence")
```

```{r columns_measurement}
helper$columns("measurement")
```

```{r columns_observation}
helper$columns("observation")
```

Now that we have a good understanding of the structure of the data we are working with, we should identify the concepts that we are interested in. Bear in mind that the OMOP CDM is designed to be used in a wide range of contexts, and therefore the concepts that are present in a database will be specific to the context of the database. 

Concepts are the building blocks of the OMOP CDM. They are used to represent the entities that are present in the database, and are based on clinical vocabularies. For the sake of standardization, concepts are represented by numerical IDs matched to terms in clinical vocabularies. For example, the concept "Chronic obstructive lung disease" is stored as concept ID 255573 in the OMOP CDM, and it is represented by this identifier across the whole database.

We can explore the concepts available in the OMOP CDM through [Athena](https://athena.ohdsi.org/), the central repository of standardized clinical vocabularies used in the OMOP CDM. Athena provides a web interface to search and browse concepts across different vocabularies and domains.

However, we can also use the `concepts` method to retrieve the concepts available in the database. This method will return a list of concept IDs present in a table, linked to the official concept name designed to it. 

Let's check the concepts available in the `condition_occurrence`, `measurement` and `observation` tables:

```{r concepts_condition_occurrence}
condition_list <- helper$concepts("condition_occurrence")
condition_list
```

```{r concepts_measurement}
measurement_list <- helper$concepts("measurement")
measurement_list
```

```{r concepts_observation}
observation_list <- helper$concepts("observation")
observation_list
```

These serve as concept catalogs for each table. We can explore them to identify the concepts that are present in the database.

For example, as an exercise, let's find the concept IDs for: 

- Systolic blood pressure
- Marital status

**Note:** For convenience, we can save these concept catalogs as files for easy reference, sharing with collaborators, and future consultation. For example, we can save them as CSV files:

```{r save_concepts, eval=FALSE}
# Create a data directory if it doesn't exist
dir.create("data", showWarnings = FALSE)

# Save the concept catalogs as CSV files
write.csv(condition_list, file = "data/condition_list.csv")
write.csv(measurement_list, file = "data/measurement_list.csv")
write.csv(observation_list, file = "data/observation_list.csv")
```

**Did you find the concepts that we are looking for?**

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click to see the solution

Let's search for these concepts in our catalogs:

1. **Systolic blood pressure**: 3004249
   - Found in Measurement
   - Concept name: Systolic blood pressure

2. **Marital status**: 40766231
   - Found in Observation
   - Concept name: Marital status [NHANES]
:::

# Data retrieval

We have identified the concepts that we are interested in. Now it is time to retrieve data from the OMOP database.

Bear in mind that we do not usually want to retrieve all the columns related to a concept. You should check the columns of the `condition_occurrence`, `measurement` and `observation` tables to identify the columns that are relevant to our analysis.

For example, let's say that we want to obtain the numerical value of the systolic blood pressure. We can check again the columns available in the `measurement` table:

```{r columns_measurement_2}
helper$columns("measurement")
```

We can see that the `measurement` table contains the `value_as_number` column, which contains the numerical value of the measurement.

This means that we want to:

- From the `measurement` table,
- get the systolic blood pressure (whose concept ID is `3004249`),
- taking only the `value_as_number` column

We can retrieve this data using the `auto` method of the `helper` interface object. This method automates the process of retrieving the data from the database and storing it in the `mimiciv` table:

```{r auto}
helper$auto(
    table = "measurement",
    concepts = 3004249,
    columns = "value_as_number"
)
```

The data should have been stored in the `mimiciv` table. `dsOMOP` automatically translantes the concept IDs to their designated textual names for readability. This means that the column name will be the concept name, followed by the column name of the table (`systolic_blood_pressure.value_as_number`). We can check the current state of the `mimiciv` table in the server side at any time using the `ds.summary` function:

```{r summary_2}
ds.summary("mimiciv")
```

As we can see, the `mimiciv` table now contains the `systolic_blood_pressure.value_as_number` column, which contains the numerical value of the systolic blood pressure. Let's check a summary of this data:

```{r data}
ds.summary("mimiciv$systolic_blood_pressure.value_as_number")
```

Let's now use the `renameVars` from the `dsHelper` package, which we have seen before, to rename the variable to `sbp` for convenience:

```{r rename_sbp, warning=FALSE}
dh.renameVars(
	df = "mimiciv", 
  current_names = c("systolic_blood_pressure.value_as_number"),
  new_names = c("sbp"))
```

Let's check whether the changes have been applied by listing the columns of the `mimiciv` table:

```{r colnames}
ds.colnames("mimiciv")
```

From this point, the data we have incorporated into the `mimiciv` table is ready to be used in our analysis as any other dataframe in DataSHIELD. To illustrate this, let's perform a `ds.histogram` to visualize the distribution of the systolic blood pressure:

```{r histogram_sbp}
ds.histogram("mimiciv$sbp")
```

Let's now retrieve the data for the concept `Marital status [NHANES]`. Let's start by checking the columns available in the `observation` table:

```{r columns_observation_2}
helper$columns("observation")
```

In this case, the `observation` table contains the `value_as_concept_id` column, which contains the concept ID of the observation value (which will be translated to the textual concept name by `dsOMOP`).

Let's use the `auto` method to retrieve it:

- From the `observation` table,
- get the marital status (whose concept ID is `40766231`),
- taking only the `value_as_concept_id` column

```{r auto_marital_status}
helper$auto(
    table = "observation",
    concepts = 40766231,
    columns = "value_as_concept_id"
)
```

We should now have the `marital_status_nhanes.value_as_concept_id` column in the `mimiciv` table. Let's check the current state of the `mimiciv` table in the server side at any time using the `ds.summary` function:

```{r summary_3}
ds.summary("mimiciv")
```

The `mimiciv` table now contains the `marital_status_nhanes.value_as_concept_id` column. Let's see a summary of this data:

```{r summary_marital_status}
ds.summary("mimiciv$marital_status_nhanes.value_as_concept_id")
```

As we can observe, the `marital_status_nhanes.value_as_concept_id` column contains the following categories: 

- `divorced`
- `married`
- `never married`
- `widowed`

Those were originally numerical concept IDs in the database, but `dsOMOP` automatically translated them to their textual names.

# Subsetting data

Another fundamental operation in the dataset construction process that may be required for specific research contexts is subsetting. It is used to filter tables based on specific criteria, such as gender, age, conditions, measurements, observations or other characteristics. This operation can be used to determine a specific cohort of individuals, since all the data that is going to be retrieved from the database from that point will be related to the remaining individuals in the `person` table.

Let’s see with a simple example how we can filter, using the subset operation, a dataset to only include women patients. But first, **where do we find the gender data?**

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click to see the solution

The gender data is part of the `person` table under the `gender_concept_id` column, which was automatically retrieved when we created the `helper` interface object. This means that it is already available in the `mimiciv` table under `mimiciv$gender_concept_id`.

:::

Let's first check that this variable is indeed available in the `mimiciv` table:

```{r colnames_3}
ds.colnames("mimiciv")
```

Let's also check a summary of this variable:

```{r summary_gender}
ds.summary("mimiciv$gender_concept_id")
```

As we can observe, the `gender_concept_id` column contains the following categories: 

- `female`
- `male`

Those were also numerical concept IDs in the database that were matched to their corresponding concept names by `dsOMOP`.

Let's start by renaming the `gender_concept_id` column to `gender` for convenience:

```{r rename_gender, warning=FALSE}
dh.renameVars(
	df = "mimiciv", 
  current_names = c("gender_concept_id"),
  new_names = c("gender"))
```

From this point on, all the data is already in the DataSHIELD environment, so we will use DataSHIELD's standard methods to perform the filtering. 

In DataSHIELD, we first need to create a filter object in the server side that contains the value we want to filter by. Let's create a `gender_filter` object that contains the value `"female"`:

```{r filter_gender}
ds.make(newobj = "gender_filter", toAssign = "c('female')")
```

Now we can use the `ds.dataFrameSubset` function to filter the `mimiciv` table to only include female patients by passing the `gender_filter` object as a parameter with the `Boolean.operator` parameter set to `"=="`:

```{r subset_gender}
ds.dataFrameSubset(
  df.name = "mimiciv",
  V1.name = "mimiciv$gender",
  V2.name = "gender_filter",
  Boolean.operator = "==",
  newobj = "mimiciv",
  datasources = conns,
  notify.of.progress = FALSE
)
```

This will override the `mimiciv` table in the server side, which will now be the same table but only containing the female patients. Let's check if this is the case: 

```{r summary_female}
ds.summary("mimiciv$gender")
```

As we can see, the `mimiciv` table contains only female patients now. If we were to retrieve any other data from the database with the `auto` method, it would only be related to the female patients from this point on.

# More advanced operations

Let's now perform a more advanced operation. We want to study the relationship between **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** and two key biomarkers: **tobacco use** and **asthma**, so we will perform a **generalized linear model (GLM)** to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of COPD for each biomarker. 

We start by creating a new `helper` interface object where we will retrieve the specified data. Since we are not going to use the `helper` object and the `mimiciv` table from the previous section anymore, we will create new objects with the same name:

```{r helper_2}
helper <- ds.omop.helper(
    connections = conns,
    resource = "omop_demo.mimiciv", 
    symbol = "mimiciv"
)
```

As we can see, the `mimiciv` table now only contains the initial `person` table again:

```{r summary_4}
ds.summary("mimiciv")
```

And we have restored all the patients that were in the `mimiciv` table from the previous section, not just the female patients:

```{r summary_female_2}
ds.summary("mimiciv$gender_concept_id")
```

We can now use the concept catalogs that we retrieved earlier to identify the concept IDs for COPD, tobacco use and asthma:

```{r concepts_condition_occurrence_2}
condition_list
```

```{r concepts_observation_2}
observation_list
```

```{r concepts_measurement_2}
measurement_list
```

**Can you identify the concept IDs for COPD, tobacco use and asthma?**

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click to see the solution

1. **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease**: 255573
   - Found in Condition occurrence
   - Concept name: Chronic obstructive lung disease

2. **Tobacco use**: 4005823
   - Found in Observation
   - Concept name: Tobacco user

3. **Asthma**: 317009
   - Found in Condition occurrence
   - Concept name: Asthma
:::

Let's now retrieve these variables from the database. In this case, our strategy will be to retrieve any form of data related to the variables we are studying. OMOP CDM tables are designed to only register the presence of a concept in a patient, so we will have to retrieve those and create auxiliar boolean variables that indicate the presence of the concept in the patient. This means that we can just retrieve the basic identifiers for each concept:

- From the `condition_occurrence` table,
- get COPD (whose concept ID is `255573`) and asthma (whose concept ID is `317009`),
- taking only the `condition_occurrence_id` column

```{r auto_copd}
helper$auto(
    table = "condition_occurrence",
    concepts = c(255573, 317009),
    columns = "condition_occurrence_id"
)
```

- From the `observation` table,
- get tobacco use (whose concept ID is `4005823`),
- taking only the `observation_id` column

```{r auto_tobacco}
helper$auto(
    table = "observation",
    concepts = 4005823,
    columns = "observation_id"
)
```

We can now check the current state of the `mimiciv` table:

```{r summary_5}
ds.summary("mimiciv")
```

As we can see, the `mimiciv` table now contains: 

- `chronic_obstructive_lung_disease.condition_occurrence_id`
- `tobacco_user.observation_id`
- `asthma.condition_occurrence_id`

We can now create boolean variables that indicate the presence of each concept in the patient. DataSHIELD will not transform an ID to a boolean if it is in a string format, so this process involves two steps:

1. Transforming the ID to numeric
2. Transforming the numeric ID to boolean

Let's start by transforming the COPD variable: 

```{r transform_copd}
# Convert COPD ID to numeric
ds.asNumeric(
    x.name = "mimiciv$chronic_obstructive_lung_disease.condition_occurrence_id",
    newobj = "copd_numeric",
    datasources = conns
)

# Convert numeric COPD to boolean
ds.Boole(
    V1 = "copd_numeric",
    V2 = 0,
    Boolean.operator = "!=",
    numeric.output = TRUE,
    na.assign = 0,
    newobj = "copd",
    datasources = conns
)
```

This has created a `copd` object in the server that contains the boolean variables indicating the presence of COPD in the patient.

```{r table_copd_boolean}
ds.table("copd")
```

Let's now repeat the same process for the tobacco use variable:

```{r transform_tobacco}
# Convert tobacco ID to numeric
ds.asNumeric(
    x.name = "mimiciv$tobacco_user.observation_id",
    newobj = "tobacco_numeric",
    datasources = conns
)

# Convert numeric tobacco to boolean 
ds.Boole(
    V1 = "tobacco_numeric",
    V2 = 0,
    Boolean.operator = "!=",
    numeric.output = TRUE,
    na.assign = 0,
    newobj = "tobacco",
    datasources = conns
)
```

and for the asthma variable:

```{r transform_asthma}
# Convert asthma ID to numeric 
ds.asNumeric(
    x.name = "mimiciv$asthma.condition_occurrence_id",
    newobj = "asthma_numeric", 
    datasources = conns
)

# Convert numeric asthma to boolean
ds.Boole(
    V1 = "asthma_numeric",
    V2 = 0,
    Boolean.operator = "!=", 
    numeric.output = TRUE,
    na.assign = 0,
    newobj = "asthma",
    datasources = conns
)
```

We can now check the presence of the `tobacco` and `asthma` objects in the server side:

```{r table_tobacco_boolean}
ds.table("tobacco")
```

```{r table_asthma_boolean}
ds.table("asthma")
```

We can now perform the GLM analysis using the `ds.glm` function from DataSHIELD:

```{r glm_copd_tobacco}
ds.glm(
    formula = "copd ~ tobacco + asthma",
    family = "binomial",
    datasources = conns
)
```

**Note:** Our dataset is very small, so the GLM analysis is not very reliable. This is just an example of how to perform a GLM analysis in DataSHIELD with data imported from an OMOP database.

# Logout

Do not forget to logout from the DataSHIELD server after finishing the exercise:

```{r logout}
datashield.logout(conns)
```
